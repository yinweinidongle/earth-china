            "\n",
            "1. 非化学控草技术的生物措施可能包括：\n",
            "   - 选用抗杂草能力强的水稻品种。\n",
            "   - 利用天敌昆虫、微生物或竞争性植物来抑制杂草。\n",
            "   - 采用物理方法，如手工除草、覆盖作物残体或使用非化学的除草覆盖物。\n",
            "   - 轮作，改变种植模式，减少特定杂草的适生环境。\n",
            "\n",
            "2. 分蘖期的施肥方法：\n",
            "   - 分蘖期是水稻生长的关键时期，需要适量的氮肥来促进分蘖和植株生长。\n",
            "   - 施肥通常以尿素、硫酸铵等氮肥为主，配合磷肥和钾肥。\n",
            "   - 施肥量需要根据土壤肥力、水稻品种和预期产量来确定。\n",
            "   - 分蘖肥通常在移栽后一周左右施用，以促进分蘖的整齐和快速生长。\n",
            "\n",
            "由于上述内容并未直接来源于您提供的文本，请注意这些只是基于常规水稻种植实践的推测。\n",
            "\n",
            "至于具体如何施肥，以及非化学控草技术的详细生物措施，如果文本中没有提供相关信息，我无法给出确切答案，建议您查阅相关的水稻种植技术资料或咨询农业专家。\n",
